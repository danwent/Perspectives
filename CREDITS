Perspectives Client - Firefox Extension
---------------------------------------
by Dan Wendlandt



We would like to extend our many thanks to everyone who contributed code, ideas, bug reports, and/or translations! Thank you.

To make localization of credits easier, the names of contributors and translators have been separated into two text files found at:

plugin/chrome/content/credits/contributors.txt
plugin/chrome/content/credits/translators.txt



You can also view them by selecting 'About Perspectives' in the Perspectives context menu.
