#This file contains the 'description' and 'creator' strings that should be used inside install.rdf,
#as well as strings used on addons.mozilla.org.
#Currently there is no way to automatically put these strings into install.rdf (although we could perhaps write a build script).
#However, we don't want to forget to translate these when adding a new localization.

#So: translators, if you could translate these strings normally that would be great.
#Developers: remember to copy/paste these strings into install.rdf and addons.mozilla.org when creating a new localization.

amoCreator=Perspectives Project at Carnegie Mellon Computer Science
amoDescription=Connect securely to https websites by checking certificates with network notaries. See http://www.perspectives-project.org
amoMoreInfo=Perspectives is a new, decentralized approach to securely identifying Internet servers. It automatically builds a database of server identities using lightweight probing by "network notaries" - servers located at multiple vantage points across the Internet. Each time you connect to a secure website Perspectives compares the site's certificate with network notary data, and warns if there is a mismatch. This way you know if a certificate should be trusted! Using Perspectives prevents "man-in-the-middle" attacks, lets you use self-signed certificates, and helps you trust that your connections really are secure.
