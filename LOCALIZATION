You want to help us translate Perspectives? AWESOME! :D

We're willing to work with you to make translation as easy as possible. Here are some options for how you can help translate Perspectives:



1. Create an account on Babelzilla:

* http://www.babelzilla.org

- Visit the Perspectives WTS page

* http://www.babelzilla.org/index.php?option=com_wts&extension=5614&type=show

- Sign up for your language and use the Babelzilla tools to translate!

There is also a Babelzilla thread for Perspectives in case you have questions: http://www.babelzilla.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=7172&st=0
Or feel free to email the dev list.


2. Fork the Perspectives project on GitHub ( https://github.com/danwent/Perspectives ), translate, and send us a pull request.

The steps to translate are:

- Create a new folder in plugin/chrome/locale
- Copy over the .dtd and .properties files from the en-US (or any other) locale
- Translate the strings inside each of those files

Then push back to Github and send us a pull request. We'll take care of the rest!


3. View the strings at https://github.com/danwent/Perspectives/tree/master/plugin/chrome/locale/en-US and email us your translations. We can use them to create a new locale.


4. Other - prefer to work via IM? Encrypted email? Carrier pidgeon? Just let us know on the mailing list https://groups.google.com/group/perspectives-dev and we can help ;)

For developers:

Steps to remember when publishing a new localization:

1. Before publishing a release, register the new locale inside chrome.manifest. e.g.
	locale perspectives fr chrome/locale/fr/

don't forget the trailing slash!

2. Write a line for the locale in the install.rdf:
	<locale> perspectives/locale/fr-FR/</locale>

adding a <Description> block with a <em:translator>translator name</em:translator> credit is a good thing.

3. Make sure to save the file as as UNIX/UTF-8 encoding.

4. Add a credit inside the AUTHORS file too
