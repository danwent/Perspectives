# Perspectives
**Connect securely to https websites by checking certificates with network notaries.**

*Perspectives* is a browser extension that helps to verify whether your connection to any web site really is secure. It does this by checking the connection *certificate* with multiple observers hosted around the world. For more information see: [http://www.perspectives-project.org](http://www.perspectives-project.org).

## Install
You can install Perspectives for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/perspectives/) or [SeaMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/perspectives/) at addons.mozilla.org. Future support for other browsers is also planned.

## Contact
You can contact the developers or post questions for discussion on the Perspectives Dev newsgroup:

## Translate

We warmly welcome anyone willing to help translate Perspectives. Please see the [translation doc for instructions](TRANSLATING.md).

## Develop

This README explains how to work with Perspectives code.

### Requirements
* a POSIX command line environment
* make
* zip

Optional (but strongly recommended!):
* python and the python 'lxml' library (to run the build tests)

### Building
To build, just type ```make``` (assuming of course you have make installed!). This will create a file called 'Perspectives.xpi'.

### Installing local builds
You can install Perspectives in Firefox in many ways:

* Using *Menu -> Add-ons -> Extensions -> (Tools icon) -> Install Add-On From File* and opening the ```Perspectives.xpi``` file.
* Drag ```Perspectives.xpi``` into your browser
* Use ```make install-fx``` from the command line to build and install in a single step. This assumes Firefox exists in your path.

### Debugging
To debug the extension:

* Download the latest [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/).
  * The latest versions usually come with better integration of debugging tools.
* Start your new browser with ```firefox -P dev -no-remote -purgecaches &```
  * You should see the profile manager on the first start which creates a new profile called "dev".
  * For further information see [MDN - Setting up extension development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment).
* In ```~/.mozilla/firefox/r4nd0m5tr.dev/extensions``` create a file called ```perspectives@cmu.edu``` and enter the text ```Path_to_your_Perspectives_clone/plugin/``` (where you cloned the git repo to).
  * This enables you to see changes without having to rebuild with ```make``` everytime.
  * Unfortunately you still have to restart the browser because Perspectives is not yet a "restartless extensions" (see [issue #76](https://github.com/danwent/Perspectives/issues/76)).
* Enter ```about:config``` in the location bar and set the following variables:
  * ```devtools.debugger.remote-enabled = true```
  * ```devtools.chrome.enabled = true```
  * This enables you to use the "Browser Toolbox" (debugger).
  * For further information again see [MDN - Setting up extension development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment).
* Restart the browser and open *Menu -> Developer -> Browser Toolbox -> Ok -> Debugger*
  * Search for the file you want to debug (e.g. ```notaries.js```).
  * Search for the code line you want to debug and set a breakpoint.
* Edit the ```d_print_flags``` in ```plugin/chrome/content/common.js``` if you like to see some useful logs.
* Optional tips if you want speed-up development a bit:
  * If you just need console logs use *Menu -> Developer -> Browser Console* (```Ctrl + Shift + J```) instead of the "Browser Toolbox". The plain console loads a little faster (Note: "Browser Console" is not the standard "Javascript Console").
  * Use the ```debugger``` keyword in Javascript to make the debugger automatically jump to the file and codeline. You need to have "Browser Toolbox" already open though!
  * You can also move the *Developer menu* into the toolbar to skip one menu step.

## Test

To test Perspectives:

* Use ```make test``` to build Perspectives.xpi, or ```make test install-fx``` to build and install all in one step (this assumes Firefox exists in your path).
* Install the plugin and restart the browser.
* Open the following URL: [chrome://perspectives/content/test/test.html](chrome://perspectives/content/test/test.html)
* Press the 'Run Tests' button. Test results will be displayed on the page.
* Optional: If you want to run the testcases without chrome privileges (i.e. without reinstalling) follow the instruction in [issue #130 - Extract test cases which require no chrome privileges](https://github.com/danwent/Perspectives/issues/130).
* The file ```test/Manual Test Cases.txt``` has lists of other tests to run through when doing a full test pass.

Some tests are performed at build time - e.g. checking localization files for the correct format and contents. All tests of the javascript code are run inside the extension - for security reasons they must be installed along with other extension files.

If you have ideas for further tests please let us know!
