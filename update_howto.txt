Here are the steps to update Perspectives:


1. Local changes

- Commit, stash, or revert all of your in-progress changes
- Build a test new version ('make test')
- Run the in-browser tests (see the README for details)
- Run the manual tests (see the tests/ directory)

Once you're confident everything works:

- Check: do you need to/can you increase the version compatibility in plugin/install.rdf ?
- Increment the version number in plugin/install.rdf
- Add a tag in git for the new version, to make it easy to find if we ever need to republish, rebuild, or for people who build from source
- Build a clean version ('make clean; make')
- Upload your changes to github
- Create a pull request to bring your changes to the main branch


2. Github

Once the pull requst has been approved:

- Add a tag in the official ('danwent') depo (if you're not a Perspectives maintainer, a maintainer will have to do this for you)
- Close any github tickets/issues fixed by the current release (bonus points: add them to the correct Milestone before closing!)


3. Mozilla

- Log in to https://addons.mozilla.org/ and upload the new version


4. Broadcast

- Post to the Perspectives blog ( http://perspectives-project.org )
- Send an email to the mailing list ( https://groups.google.com/group/perspectives-dev
