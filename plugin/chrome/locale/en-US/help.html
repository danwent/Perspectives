<h1>Perspectives Help</h1>
<h3> What is Perspectives? </h3> 
<p> Perspectives helps prevent "Man-in-the-Middle" attacks against HTTPS communication by
verifying the authenticity of the server's SSL public key.  
This is particularly important when you connect to websites
that have "self-signed", mismatched, or expired certificates, which cause Security Errors and
prevent you from connecting to some HTTPS websites.  
</p> 

<h3> How Does it Work? </h3> 
<p> Perspectives builds on the fact that most of the time the Internet works correctly.  
When attacks do occur, they are likely to be either limited in scope (e.g., a 
single compromised router) or limited in duration (since large attacks can be more easily detected).  
Perspectives uses periodic network probing from many vantage points across the Internet 
to help your browser detect both types of attacks.  A set of
machines called "network notaries" 
scattered across the Internet and run by academic researchers periodically probe each server
to request its current public key.  When your browser needs to authenticate a key, it asks each of  
network notary for the keys they have seen the server using over time and verify that these records
are consistent with the key they received.  Thus, in order to fool your browser into accepting an
invalid key, an attacker must be on all network paths between a notary and have compromised those
paths for a significant amount of time such that the key change is not deemed suspicious.  
In this way, Perspectives implements a type of ``lightweight PKI'',
with network probes from multiple vantage points taking the place of manual verification performed
by certificate authorities (e.g., Verisign).
</p> 

<h3> Preferences </h3> 

<p> This section helps you understand the configuration parameters you can control via
Perspective's "Preferences" panel.</p> 

<p><b>Security Settings: What is Quorum and Quorum Duration?</b> </p> 
The preferences dialog lets you configure different values for "Quorum" and "Quorum Duration".
These threshold values let you decide how paranoid you want to be about accepting keys.  In both cases, 
higher values are more secure, but also run the risk of incorrectly determining that a key is
invalid.  Quorum is a threshold value that describes, as a percentage, the minimum percentage of 
notaries that must agree about a key for it to be considered valid.  Reasonable values are between 
100% and 50%.  Quorum Duration specifies the number of days that observations must be consistent, to help protect against short-lived attacks.  If you specify a Quorum Duration D other than zero, this is saying that you want
to reject a unless a quorum fraction of notaries have observed that key consistently for the past D
hours.  Because your request to the network notary may be the first time it has heard about a 
particular server, it may have no available key history.  As a result, setting D to a value greater
than zero will cause more valid keys to be rejected.  
</p> 

<p> <b>  Invalid Certificate Exceptions </b> </p>
<p> When a certificate satisfies quorum duration,
Perspectives can install an exception for that certificate so that Firefox will not show a security error
page for pages using that certificate.  You can choose whether Perspectives installs these exceptions,
and if so, if these exceptions should be permanent.
