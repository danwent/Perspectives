This directory includes the code for the Perspectives Firefox client.  

For more information on Perspectives, see: http://www.perspectives-project.org


HACKING

To build, just type "make" (assuming of course you have make installed!). This will create a file called 'Perspectives.xpi'.  

You can run this in Firefox using File -> Open and browsing to the Perspectives.xpi file.  

To debug the extension:

* Edit the d_print_flags in plugin/chrome/content/common.js
* Rebuild using make
* Reload the extension and restart your browser
* Use the Firefox extension 'Firebug' to view what's happening as Perspectives runs

Feel free to try Venkman or other debug methods (cf. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Setting_up_extension_development_environment )
