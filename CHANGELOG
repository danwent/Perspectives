High-level overview of changes to Perspectives

Format:
+ new feature
* bug or behavior fix
X Loss of functionality


4.3.6
-----
* Security Fix: incorrect quorum duration with low number of notaries or quorum percentage (GH 87)
* Refactor unit tests: unit test js file is now optionally installed with the rest of the extension (this makes it run properly under newer versions of Firefox) (GH 74)
* Remove several global variables; convert to local with 'var'
* Add new whitelist icon (image file added, but code not hooked up yet)
* Minor improvements to the makefile formatting and output
X Localization tests temporarily removed so we can ship to patch the security bug. They still need to be transcribed/relocated to a non-javascript language to run at build time.


4.3.5
-----
* Fix code for retrieving private browsing data (used for untrusted certs in Firefox v22 and up)
* Two minor fixes to remove validation warnings on AMO

4.3.4
-----
* Update code for retrieving invalid certificate info for Firefox v20 (GH 77)
* When sending requeries, only send to notaries that haven't yet replied.
* Remove unused localization string
* UI improvements:
	* Make the Preferences and Report Attack windows resizable
	* In the Preferences window, set proper default height and width for Notary Server textboxes
	* In the Results window, expand the results textbox vertically to fill available space (This makes more text visible and keeps the radio buttons in a consistent place)


4.3.3
-----
+ Add heimdal and nine-eyes notaries to the default notary list, to improve response rate


4.3.2
-----
* extract hardcoded strings and move to localization files
+ add (de), (es), and (fr) localizations! Many thanks to our translators.
