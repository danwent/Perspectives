# Translating Perspectives

Do you speak a language other than English? Are you willing to donate some time translating English sentences? **Great!**

Perspectives needs both:
* Translations to new languages
* Translating English that remains in the current languages

We're willing to work with you to make translation as easy as possible. Here are some options for how you can help translate Perspectives.

### How to publish a new localization

0. Make sure all ```.dtd``` and ```.properties``` files are saved as UTF-8 with no BOM. Otherwise many things fail horribly. The python unit tests should detect this and fail any builds that don't match, so be sure to install python.

1. Before publishing a release, register the new locale inside ```chrome.manifest```. e.g.

 ```locale perspectives fr chrome/locale/fr/```

 Don't forget the trailing slash!

2. Write a line for the locale inside ```install.rdf```:

 ```<locale> perspectives/locale/fr-FR/</locale>```

 Adding a ```<Description>``` block with a ```<em:translator>translator name</em:translator>``` credit is a good thing.
Also ask your translator nicely to translate the 'description' and 'creator' fields.

3. Make sure to save the file as as UNIX/UTF-8 encoding.

4. Add a credit inside ```plugin/chrome/content/credits/translators.txt``` (or a credit to 'anonymous', if the translator prefers)
