High-level overview of changes to Perspectives

Format:
+ new feature
* bug or behavior fix
X Loss of functionality

We attempt to use meaningful version numbers, following semver.org:
	Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
	MAJOR version when you make large architectural changes,
	MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
	PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.


NEXT
----
* Begin extracting browser-specific functionality to its own object/interface,
to group everything together. (GH #75)
	* Preference gets/sets (GH #171)
	* String bundle retrieval (GH #172)
* Delete old code for update prompt and old preference 'prompt_update_all_https_setting'
* Remove init_data() initialization function
* Fix global variables left in Pers_report object (convert to local scope)
* Combine all localized property strings into a single file
(makes string-loading interface much easier)


4.6.4
-----
* Fix preference storage location: migrate all prefs from 'perspectives.X' to 'extensions.perspectives.X'. This is a requirement of hosting addons on addons.mozilla.org - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/AMO/Policy/Reviews#Full_Review
	All credit and thanks to Alexey Vesnin for the move and code to gracefully migrate existing user prefs. Thanks Alexey!
* Mark some tests as known failures, to identify for long-term fixing
* Add error checking for security level preference to correct invalid values
* Remove unused preference 'show_label'
* Internal code cleanup (fix === checks; remove dead code; fix addProgressListener usage)
* Add wrapper functions to retrieve preferences, overrideService, and stringbundle strings
	Fixes one bug where 'root_prefs' object was not initialized;
	but overall removes the need to initialize the Perspectives object at all.
	It can and should handle its own internal state.
	This starts to isolate the usage of direct browser internals,
	which would be required to port to other browsers.
	Also makes the code much more stable and testable.
* Clean up the init code to use the new wrapped preference and stringbundle functions


4.6.3
-----
* Update checkloc library to import behaviour fix, so Perspectives will build again with all tests intact. Fix for behaviour change in lxml 3.5.0 (GH #166)


4.6.2
-----
* Fix several bugs that violate the AMO review policy so we can continue to deploy client updates through addons.mozilla.org:
	* Move initialization script to separate file rather than holding the code inline (GH #162)
	* Fix initial setup to add Perspectives button to the correct place (GH #161)
	* Fix addProgressListener usage (GH #103 )
	* Remove synchronous call to nsIDNSService.resolve() (GH #160)
	Fixes mainly based on patches submitted by Alexey V., with slight modifications.
	Thanks Alexey!


4.6.1
-----
* Add (ru) Russian translation! Many thanks to Alexey V!
* Fill in CHANGELOG history from versions before 4.3

* Convert translation file to markdown format
+ Unlock the 'About' dialog
* Fix some test data, fix tests, add new tests for client policy code

---

+ Expose maximum caching duration as a user preference
+ Improve whitelist interface:
	* Convert whitelist textfield into a table with columns
	+ Domain column is sortable
	+ Regexes can be clicked and edited
	+ Whitelist entries can be clicked to activate or deactivate
	+ Table supports multi row selection and removal
	+ Added localizations (en, de) for columns and remove button

* Extract remaining hardcoded strings for localization
* Some German (de) localization fixes
* Convert some alerts to Perspectives wrapped alerts
* Prevent the addition of duplicate notaries
* Correctly detected and set status for "quorum not reached" in non-english languages.
X Temporarily remove all 'Report Attack' functionality, until the feature is fixed
* Check if result signature and timestamps are correct when processing notary results, and visually mark as red if either is incorrect

* Clean up unit tests so many tests are more clear, better organized, and/or easier to maintain
* Refactor test file so more tests can be run without installing the extension (i.e. separate chrome-dependent functionality from non-chrome-dependent functionality)
* Many areas of code cleanup (add hasOwnProperty checks; fix === checks)
* Remove dead statusbar elements


4.5.2
-----

4.5
---

* Update German translations (thanks Patrick!)
* Unlock Dutch and Finnish translations (thanks Alf and Ville!). These translations are not fully complete, but enabling them at least lets people see *some* text in their desired language.
* Remove perspectives1.networknotary.org from the set of default notaries. This notary needs to be upgraded before it can be used full-time.


4.4

* Refactor unit tests: unit test js file is now optionally installed with the rest of the extension (this makes it run properly under newer versions of Firefox) (GH 74)
* Remove several global variables; convert to local with 'var'
* Add new whitelist icon (image file added, but code not hooked up yet)
* Minor improvements to the makefile formatting and output
X Localization tests temporarily removed so we can ship to patch the security bug. They still need to be transcribed/relocated to a non-javascript language to run at build time. (fixed in 4.4.1)

* UI improvements:
	* Make the Preferences and Report Attack windows resizable
	* In the Preferences window, set proper default height and width for Notary Server textboxes
