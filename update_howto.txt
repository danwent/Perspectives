Updating Perspectives is now easy: simply log in to https://addons.mozilla.org/ and upload a new version.


After updating, remember to:

* Post to the Perspectives blog ( http://perspectives-project.org )
* Send an email to perspectives-announce ( https://groups.google.com/group/perspectives-announce )
* Close any Issues fixed in GitHub
* Add a tag in git for the new version, to make it easy to find if we ever need to republish, or anyone wants to restore to that build.
